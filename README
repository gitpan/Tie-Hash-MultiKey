NAME
    Tie::Hash::MultiKey - multiple keys per value

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::Hash::MultiKey;

      $accessor = tie %hash, qw(Tie::Hash::MultiValue);
      $accessor = tied %hash;

      $hash{'foo'}        = 'baz';
            or
      $hash{'foo', 'bar'} = 'baz';
            or
      $array_ref = ['foo', 'bar'];
      $hash{ $array_ref } = 'baz';

      print $hash{foo};     # prints 'baz'
      print $hash{bar};     # prints 'baz'

      $array_ref = ['fuz','zup'];
      $val = tied(%hash)->addkey('fuz' => 'bar');
      $val = tied(%hash)->addkey('fuz','zup' => 'bar');
      $val = tied(%hash)->addkey( $array_ref => 'bar');

      print $hash{fuz}      # prints 'baz'

      $array_ref = ['foo', 'bar'];
      $val = tied(%hash)->remove('foo');
      $val = tied(%hash)->remove('foo', 'bar');
      $val = tied(%hash)->remove( $array_ref );

      @list = tied(%hash)->keylist('foo')

      $num_vals = tied(%hash)->consolidate;

      All of the above methods can be accessed as:

      i.e.  $accessor->consolidate;

DESCRIPTION
    Tie::Hash::MultiKey creates hashes that can have multiple keys for a
    single value. As shown in the SYNOPSIS, multiple keys share a common
    value.

    Additional keys can be added that share the same value and keys can be
    removed without deleting other keys that share that value.

    STORE..ing a value for one or more keys that already exist will
    overwrite the existing value and add any missing keys to the key group
    for that value.

    WARNING: multiple key values supplied as an ARRAY to STORE and DELETE
    operations are passed by Perl as a single string separated by the $;
    multidimensional array seperator. i.e.

            $hash{'a','b','c'} = $something;
      or
            @keys = ('a','b','c');
            $hash{@keys} = $something'

    This really means $hash{join($;, 'a','b','c')};

    Tie::Hash::MultiKey will do the right thing as long as your keys DO NOT
    contain binary data the may include the $; separator character.

    It is recommended that you use the ARRAY_REF construct to supply
    multiple keys for binary data. i.e.

            $hash{['a','b','c']} = $something;
      or
            $keys = ['a','b','c'];
            $hash{$keys} = $something;

    This construct is ALWAYS safe.

    * $val = ->addkey('new_key' => 'existing_key');
        Add one or more keys to the shared key group for a particular value.

          input:        array or array_ref,
                        existing_key
          returns:      hash value
                    or  dies with stack trace

        Dies with stack trace if existing_key does not exist OR if new key
        belongs to another key set.

        Arguments may be a single SCALAR, ARRAY, or ARRAY_REF

    * $val = ->remove('key');
        Remove one or more keys from the shared key group for a particular
        value If this operation removes the LAST key, then it performs a
        DELETE which is the same as:

                delete $hash{key};

        remove returns a reverse list of the removed value's by key

          i.e.  @val = remove(something);
           or   $val = remove(something);

        Arguments may be a single SCALAR, ARRAY or ARRAY_REF

    * @list = ->keylist('foo');
        Returns all the shared keys for KEY 'foo', including 'foo'

          input:        key
          returns:      @shared_keys

    * ->consolidate;
        USE WITH CAUTION

        This method consolidates all keys with a common values.

          returns: number of consolidated key groups

COMMON OPERATIONS
    A tied multikey %hash behave like a regular %hash for most operations;

      B<$value = $hash{$key}> returns the key group value

      B<$hash{$key} = $value> sets the value for the key group
      i.e. all keys in the group will return that value

      B<$hash{$key1,$key2} = $value assigns $value to the key
      key group consisting of $key1, $key2 if they do not.
      If at least one of the keys already exists, the remaining
      keys are assigned to the key group and the value is set
      for the entire group.

      B<Better> syntax $hash{[$key,$key]} = $value;

      B<delete $hash{$key}> deletes the ENTIRE key group
      to which B<$key> belongs.

      B<delete $hash($key1,$key2> deletes ALL groups
      to which $key1 and $key2 belong.

      B<Better> syntax delete $hash{[$key1,$key2]};

      B<keys %hash> returns all keys.

      B<values %hash> returns all values
      NOTE: that this will not be the same number of
      items as returned by B<keys> unless there are no
      key groups containing more than one key.

      B<($k,$v) = each %hash> behaves as expected.

    References to tied %hash behave in the same manner as regular %hash's
    except as noted for multiple key values above.

LIMITATIONS
    SLICE operations may produce unusual results. Tie::Hash::MultiKey hashs
    only accept SCALAR or ARRAY_REF arguments for SLICE and direct
    assigment.

      i.e.
            %WRONG = (
                    one     => 1,
                    two     => 2,
                    (3,4,5) => 12 # expands to 3 => 4, 5 => 12
            );

            %hash = ( # OK
                    one     => 1,
                    two     => 2,
                    [3,4,5] => 12
            );

    will produce a psuedo hash of the form:

            %hash = (
                    one     => 1,
                    two     => 2,
                    3       => 12, --|
                    4       => 12, --|
                    5       => 12  --|
            );

    where the operation $hash{4} = 99 will change the hash to:

            %hash = (
                    one     => 1,
                    two     => 2,
                    3       => 99, --|
                    4       => 99, --|
                    5       => 99  --|
            );

    Example: $hp = \%hash;

      @{$hp}{'one','two','[3,4,5]} = (1,2,12);

    produces the same result as above. If the hash already contains a KEY of
    the same name, the value will be changed for all other shared keys.

     --------------------------

    If you are using ARRAY_REF's as keys (not as pointers to keys as above)
    they must be blessed into some other package so that

            ref $key ne 'ARRAY'

    i.e. bless $key, 'KEY'; # or anything other than 'ARRAY'

     --------------------------

    Example SLICE assignments

    TO tied hash

            @tiedhash{@keys} = @values;

            $hp = \%tiedhash;
            @{$hp}{@keys} =  @values;

    FROM tied hash

            @values = @tiedhash{@keys};

            $hp = \%tiedhash;
            @values = @{$hp}{@keys};

    NOTE: when assigning TO the hash, keys may be ARRAY_REF's as described
    above.
