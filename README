NAME
    Tie::Hash::MultiKey - multiple keys per value

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::Hash::MultiKey;

      $thm = tie %hash, qw(Tie::Hash::MultiValue);
      $thm = tied %hash;

      untie %hash;

      ($href,$thm) = new Tie::Hash::MultiValue;

      $hash{'foo'}        = 'baz';
            or
      $hash{'foo', 'bar'} = 'baz';
            or
      $array_ref = ['foo', 'bar'];
      $hash{ $array_ref } = 'baz';

      print $hash{foo};     # prints 'baz'
      print $hash{bar};     # prints 'baz'

      $array_ref = ['fuz','zup'];
      $val = tied(%hash)->addkey('fuz' => 'bar');
      $val = tied(%hash)->addkey('fuz','zup' => 'bar');
      $val = tied(%hash)->addkey( $array_ref => 'bar');

      print $hash{fuz}      # prints 'baz'

      $array_ref = ['foo', 'bar'];
      $val = tied(%hash)->remove('foo');
      $val = tied(%hash)->remove('foo', 'bar');
      $val = tied(%hash)->remove( $array_ref );

      @ordered_keys = tied(%hash)->keylist('foo')
      @allkeys_by_order = tied(%hash)->keylist();
      @slotlist = tied(%hash)->slotlist($i);

      $num_vals = tied(%hash)->consolidate;

      ($newRef,$newThm) = tied(%hash)->clone();
      $newThm = tied(%hash)->copy(tied(%new));

      All of the above methods can be accessed as:

      i.e.  $thm->consolidate;

DESCRIPTION
    Tie::Hash::MultiKey creates hashes that can have multiple ordered keys
    for a single value. As shown in the SYNOPSIS, multiple keys share a
    common value.

    Additional keys can be added that share the same value and keys can be
    removed without deleting other keys that share that value.

    STORE..ing a value for one or more keys that already exist will
    overwrite the existing value and add any missing keys to the key group
    for that value.

    WARNING: multiple key values supplied as an ARRAY to STORE and DELETE
    operations are passed by Perl as a single string separated by the $;
    multidimensional array seperator. i.e.

            $hash{'a','b','c'} = $something;
      or
            @keys = ('a','b','c');
            $hash{@keys} = $something'

    This really means $hash{join($;, 'a','b','c')};

    Tie::Hash::MultiKey will do the right thing as long as your keys DO NOT
    contain binary data the may include the $; separator character.

    It is recommended that you use the ARRAY_REF construct to supply
    multiple keys for binary data. i.e.

            $hash{['a','b','c']} = $something;
      or
            $keys = ['a','b','c'];
            $hash{$keys} = $something;

    The ARRAY_REF construct is ALWAYS safe.

    * $thm = tie %hash,'Tie::Hash::MultiValue';
        Ties a %hash to this package for enhanced capability and returns a
        method pointer.

          my %hash;
          my $thm = tie %hash,'Tie::Hash::MultiValue';

    * $thm = tied %hash;
        Returns a method pointer for this package.

    * untie %hash;
        Breaks the binding between a variable and this package. There is no
        affect if the variable is not tied.

    * ($href,$thm) = new Tie::Hash::MultiKey;
        This method returns an UNBLESSED reference to an anonymous tied
        %hash.

          input:        none
          returns:      unblessed tied %hash reference,
                        object handle

        To get the object handle from \%hash use this.

                $thm = tied %{$href};

        In SCALAR context it returns the unblessed %hash pointer. In ARRAY
        context it returns the unblessed %hash pointer and the package
        object/method pointer.

    * $val = $thm->addkey('new_key' => 'existing_key');
        Add one or more keys to the shared key group for a particular value.

          input:        array or array_ref,
                        existing_key
          returns:      hash value
                    or  dies with stack trace

        Dies with stack trace if existing_key does not exist OR if new key
        belongs to another key set.

        Arguments may be a single SCALAR, ARRAY, or ARRAY_REF

    * $val = ->remove('key');
        Remove one or more keys from the shared key group for a particular
        value If this operation removes the LAST key, then it performs a
        DELETE which is the same as:

                delete $hash{key};

        remove returns a reverse list of the removed value's by key

          i.e.  @val = remove(something);
           or   $val = remove(something);

        Arguments may be a single SCALAR, ARRAY or ARRAY_REF

    * @ordered_keys = $thm->keylist('foo');
    * @allkeys_by_order = $thm->keylist();
        Returns all the keys in the group that includes the KEY 'foo' in the
        order that they were added to the %hash;

        If no argument is specified, returns all the keys in the %hash in
        the order that they were added to the %hash

          input:        key or EMPTY
          returns:      @ordered_keys

          returns:      () if $key is not in the %hash

    * @keys = $thm->slotlist($i);
        Returns one key from each key group in position $i.

          i.e.
                $thm = tie %hash, 'Tie::Hash::MultiKey';

                $hash{['a','b','c']} = 'one';
                $hash{['d','e','f']} = 'two';
                $hash{'g'}           = 'three';
                $hash{['h','i','j']} = 'four';

                @slotkeys = $thm->slotlist(1);

          will produce ('b','e', undef, 'i')

        All the keys at index '1' for the groups to which they were added,
        in the order which the FIRST KEY in the group was added to the
        %hash. If there is no key in the specified slot, an undef is
        returned for that position.

    * $thm->consolidate;
        USE WITH CAUTION

        Consolidate all keys with the same values into common groups.

          returns: number of consolidated key groups

    * ($href,$thm) = $thm->clone();
        This method returns an UNBLESSED reference to an anonymous tied
        %hash that is a deep copy of the parent object.

          input:        none
          returns:      unblessed tied %hash reference,
                        object handle

        To get the object handle from \%hash use this.

                $thm = tied %{$href};

        In SCALAR context it returns the unblessed %hash pointer. In ARRAY
        context it returns the unblessed %hash pointer and the package
        object/method pointer.

          i.e.
                $newRef = $thm->clone();

                $newRref->{'a','b'} = 'content'

                $newThm = tied %{$newRef};

    * $new_thm = $thm->copy(tie %new,'Tie::Hash::MultiKey');
        This method deep copies a MultiKey %hash to another new %hash. It
        may be invoked on an existing tied object handle or a reference to a
        tied %hash.

          input:        object handle OR reference to tied %hash
          returns:      object handle / method pointer

          i.e
                $thm = tie %hash,'Tie::Hash::MultiKey';
                $newThm = $thm->copy(tie %new,'Tie::Hash::MultiKey');
          or
                tie %new,'Tie::Hash::MultiKey');
                $newThm = $thm->copy(\%new);

        NOTE: this method duplicates the data stored in the parent %hash,
        overwriting and destroying anything that may have been stored in the
        copy target.

COMMON OPERATIONS
    A tied multikey %hash behave like a regular %hash for most operations;

    $value = $hash{$key} returns the key group value

    $hash{$key} = $value sets the value for the key group

      i.e. all keys in the group will return that value

    $hash{$key1,$key2} = $value assigns $value to the key key group
    consisting of $key1, $key2 if they do not. If at least one of the keys
    already exists, the remaining keys are assigned to the key group and the
    value is set for the entire group.

    Better syntax $hash{[$key,$key]} = $value;

    delete $hash{$key} deletes the ENTIRE key group to which $key belongs.

    delete $hash($key1,$key2) deletes ALL groups to which $key1 and $key2
    belong.

    Better syntax delete $hash{[$key1,$key2]};

    keys %hash returns all keys.

    values %hash returns all values

    NOTE: that this will not be the same number of items as returned by keys
    unless there are no key groups containing more than one key.

    ($k,$v) = each %hash behaves as expected.

    References to tied %hash behave in the same manner as regular %hash's
    except as noted for multiple key values above.

LIMITATIONS
    SLICE operations will produce unusual results if you try to use regular
    ARRAYS to specify key groups in the slice. Tie::Hash::MultiKey %hash's
    only accept SCALAR or ARRAY_REF arguments for SLICE and direct
    assigment.

      i.e.
            %WRONG = (
                    one     => 1,
                    two     => 2,
                    (3,4,5) => 12 # expands to 3 => 4, 5 => 12
            );

            %hash = ( # OK
                    one     => 1,
                    two     => 2,
                    [3,4,5] => 12
            );

    will produce a psuedo hash of the form:

            %hash = (
                    one     => 1,
                    two     => 2,
                    3       => 12, --|
                    4       => 12, --|
                    5       => 12  --|
            );

    where the operation $hash{4} = 99 will change the hash to:

            %hash = (
                    one     => 1,
                    two     => 2,
                    3       => 99, --|
                    4       => 99, --|
                    5       => 99  --|
            );

    Example: $hp = \%hash;

      @{$hp}{'one','two','[3,4,5]} = (1,2,12);

    produces the same result as above. If the hash already contains a KEY of
    the same name, the value will be changed for all other shared keys.

     --------------------------

    If you are using ARRAY_REF's as keys (not as pointers to keys as above)
    they must be blessed into some other package so that

            ref $key ne 'ARRAY'

    i.e. bless $key, 'KEY'; # or anything other than 'ARRAY'

     --------------------------

    Example SLICE assignments

    TO tied hash

            @tiedhash{@keys} = @values;

            $hp = \%tiedhash;
            @{$hp}{@keys} =  @values;

    FROM tied hash

            @values = @tiedhash{@keys};

            $hp = \%tiedhash;
            @values = @{$hp}{@keys};

    NOTE: when assigning TO the hash, keys may be ARRAY_REF's as described
    above.
